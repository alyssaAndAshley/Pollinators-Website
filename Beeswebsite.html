  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <div class="first-paragraph">
      <p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;" style="margin-left:5px;">
        When you think of a bee, what do you think of?
        A yellow and black striped flying insect that
        pollinates flowers? Well that is only true for
        a handful of species. There are over 20,000 bee
        species in the world today. Some are hairy,
        brilliant blue while others would prefer their
         distance rather than living in a hive with
         hundreds of others. Even though they are all
         different in so many ways, they do have some
         common attributes. They are all pollinators.</p>
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">
	Bees are essential pollinators, wild and commercial bees alike pollinate up
  to 75% of the world’s farms. On average they produce $1,215 worth of pollination
  for the fields. An average farm in the United States has 444 acres. That means
  that per average bees save farmers $539,460. That’s the morgage of some
houses! Helping and saving bees is not optional, our futures and ecosystems
  depend on them. With so many species already in danger, we as a human race
   will not have so much time before many species become extinct.  </p>

<h2>The Genus Bombus (Bumblebees)</h2>
  <div class="first-paragraph">
<p class="tab"style="margin-left:5px;">
Bumblebees is a genus with over 250 species. They are mainly native to North
America, and even are some of the most common of the wild bees in North America.
 Bumblebees pollinate many different kinds of plants and vegetables, including
 blueberries, cucumbers, melons, peppers, tomatoes, squash, strawberries, and
 other vegetables.They even have their own way of pollinating, called buzz
  pollinating.  It is when they vibrate the flower, which can cause all of the
   pollen to release and stick to the bumblebees fuzziness. This allows them to
    be more effective than a honey bee. Over 65,000 bumblebees are shipped to
    the United Kingdom for exactly this reason. </p>

<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">Although they do create hives, they do not store their food like honey bees.
They cannot create honey as a result. This is because the hives themselves do
not survive the winter. The queen bee burrows under the ground and stays there
for the winter until next spring where it can start a new hive. </p>
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">
In certain parts of North America, some species have completely died off, gone
 extinct or are highly endangered. One of these endangered species is the Bombus
  Franklini. The Bombus Franklini was a very prominent species in Oregon through
   California, however it has continued to decline over time and is quite a rare
    sight today. It’s habitat is mainly the old burrows of different rodents.
    The flowers that they mainly pollinate are floral flowers such as Lupines,
    Escholzia and Giant Hyssops.</p> </div>

<h2>Common Eastern Bumblebee (Bombus Impatiens)</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph" class="tab"><p class="tab"style="margin-left:5px;">
One of the most common and important bumblebees is the Bombus Impatiens, also
known as the Common Eastern Bumblebee is found mainly on the Eastern Coast of
the North America in cities. Although it can sometimes be found in California
because many farmers brought it over to try and replace another Bumblebee species.
 They are often seen still pollinating the fall, as late as November when other
 pollinators have started to hibernate or are done for the season.

<h2>Honey Bees</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph" style="margin-top:110px;">
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">Although not native to the North American continent, Honey bees have become a
vital part of the agriculture here. The most popular commercial bee is the Apis
Mellifera also known as the Western or European Honey bee. It is one of seven
species that produces honey, they store nectar and pollen for food sources in
their hive during the winter. Although the species are very important, honey
bees have also seen a decline and are considered endangered presently. Previously
in 1947 there were 5.9 million colonies of honey bees, in 2008 it was 2.44
 million and in 2017 there were 2.67 million, according to Discover Magazine.
  Since their introduction however, the honeybees are in some way an invasive
   species to some since they can outcompete other pollinators.</p></div>
