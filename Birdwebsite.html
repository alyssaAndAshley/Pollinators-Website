                        <h2>Birds</h2>
                        <div class="first-paragraph">
                      <p class="tab" style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
  Birds come in all different shapes, colors and sizes. There are over 10,000
  species of birds worldwide. About 2,000 of them are pollinating birds. These
  birds are crucial to their ecosystems, because they've evolved right alongside
  the plants there, and are specially suited for them. A majority of these
  pollinating birds have long beaks, that are mainly curved so that they can
  reach the nectar inside of the different flowers. Most of the pollinating birds
   are abundant in the more topic areas. Although there is no crop in the North
   American continent that needs bird pollinators, wild flowers and crops in the
   tropic do. Without these pollinators we may not have the wide variety of crops
   and foods to choose from. </p>
<p style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
Most of these pollinating birds like flowers that are bright in color, usually
red, odorless, they must be strong enough for the birds to land on, and open for
 during the day time. Most pollinating birds have long beaks that are curved so
 that they can reach inside of the flower and retrieve the nectar. By doing this
 they end up getting pollen on their beak and as they go from flower to flower
 they end up pollinating. Some of the crops that need bird pollinators are papaya,
  and banana along with many others.</p>

<h2>Hummingbirds</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph">
<p class="tab" style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
One of the most common of answers when most Americans are asked about a species
of a pollinating bird will be a hummingbird. Hummingbirds are typically small,
in the three inch to five inch range, and have slim beaks. Some hummingbirds can
 even travel up to 3,000 miles a year. What is even more amazing is that they can
 flap their wings over 80 times in the amount of time it takes for you to blink.</p>

<h2>Hummingbirds in the Midwest</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph">
<p class="tab" style="margin-top: -14px;margin-left:5px;">
In the United States of America there are almost a dozen species under this genus.
 In the midwest region you might find  Black-chinned, Calliope, Rufous and
 Broad-tailed hummingbirds, and Ruby-throated. They usually migrate from this area
to more warmer areas for the winter, and usually will return again in April and
May. These birds help to pollinate some of the crops in this region. These
hummingbirds will typically eat nectar but also other flying insects (Have to keep
that mosquito population down!)</p></div>
