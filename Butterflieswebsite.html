            <h2>Butterflies</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph" style="margin-top: 80px"><p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">
There are over 17,500 species of butterflies in the world and 750 species in the
 United States. Although many admire them for their beauty butterflies are
 highly important to pollination. Each pollinator has their own unique features
  that make them better at certain things. Butterflies  are less effective at
  pollinating than bees since they have shorter legs and they are not as “fuzzy”
   as them. However, they are better for evenly distributing pollen across long
   distances since they migrate, better for high amounts of cross-pollination and
    have great vision. </p>
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">
Butterflies are able to see a multitude of colors like red which bees cannot,
 in addition they use UV rays to help locate and mark flowers. This allows
 them to be attracted to different flowers than other pollinators. When butterflies
locate a flower that they view as a good food source, they land, and use their
tongue to retrieve the nectar after tasting it with their feet. Some pollen
gets attached or stuck onto their feet. The next time they land on a different
 flower, that flower will then be pollinated to a certain degree. Butterflies
 typically like flowers that are bright in color, are in clusters, have large
 amounts of nectar and are typically open during the day.</p></div>


<h2>Monarch Butterflies</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph"style="margin-top: 80px">
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">Monarch Butterflies are one of the most
 well known species in America since they are native. Their marvelous patterns
 seem to be mystic and marvelous to so many. Each pattern acts as a fingerprint,
 it helps to identify them. Monarchs take long journeys, they travel from the
 Northern United States of America and Canada to Mexico and the Southern
 United States of America. However, for all that they do, they are endangered.
 In certain areas of the United States there are not ample supplies of
 milkweed for them to breed and lay their eggs on. In addition, when they
 migrate to Mexico there are not large enough forests or enough forests to
 hibernate in. In some areas in Mexico, there was a 53% decrease of Monarch
 butterflies in certain places. If that was not bad enough,because of
 climate change, where they reside currently over the winter may have to
  be changed. </p>
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">
Milkweed although seen as a boring green plant by most humans, is an essential
plant to Monarch Butterflies, it is what provides pupae and caterpillars
protection and food. When the eggs of monarch butterflies hatch, they then become
 caterpillars. Those caterpillars need an abundant amount of milkweed in order to
  go into their next stage, becoming a pupa and forming a chrysalis. After they
  break out of that chrysalis they become a full fledged butterfly. Since the
  butterfly ate the milkweed, a plant that is toxic to most animals, they have
  some of these toxins in themself too, and can help to ward off other animals.
  If a predator eats a monarch butterfly, the consequences for them can be severe,
  when a monarch butterfly is digested it subsequently poisons the predator.
  Milkweed is necessary for a monarch's survival, and in many places where there
  is milkweed they use pesticides which can kill many of the caterpillars, leaving
 less pupa which results in fewer butterflies.</p>
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">
When Monarch butterflies travel, they usually will travel in very large colonies,
 sometimes reaching over 10 million. By travelling in these large numbers, they
 will be able to create heat when they are hibernating. Monarchs are one of the
 only species of butterfly that make two trips, one to the southern parts of
 North America where they over winter, and with each generation, they continue
 to travel more North. In a cycle, the first generation may travel to Mexico or
 southern California, and over winter there, they travel to the Midwest region
 which is where they will lay their eggs on milkweed. Those Monarchs then
 overwinter again in Mexico, and as this continues, the offspring continually
 go more North. Monarchs are fascinating creatures and very well known, however
  they are becoming eating quickly, they need our help.

<h2>  Palos Verdes Blue</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph" style="margin-top: 80px;">
<p class="tab" style="margin-left:5px;">Palos Verdes Blue butterflies are highly endangered in the United States.It is
mainly found in Los Angeles, in the Palos Verdes Peninsula and County. This
species branched off of another butterfly named Silvery Blue. They were first
thought to be discovered in the 1970s, although there are no estimations from
that time or in the 1980s, scientists believe there were probably less than 300
individuals in the county. Palos Verdes Blue butterflies. As the years went on
their food sources were almost completely gone, and  numbers decreased, eventually
 reaching only 4-7 sightings. However, there has been a captive propagation
 effort in the area, and in 2005 there were reported to be 93 new additional
 butterflies and pupae.</p>
