                        <h2>Pollinators declination</h2>
                    <div class="first-paragraph"style="margin-top:80px;">
                      <p class="tab">

There are many different reasons for pollinators' decline and in some cases they are very unique. The problem of
pollinators declination is a very large and urgent problem that needs to be addressed. They play a vital role in
the health of ecosystems and in all organisms lives. Without them many plants would not be able to reproduce and
as a result many organisms would die from the lack of those fruits, vegetables and plants.</p>
</div>

<h2>Deforestation </h2>
<div class="first-paragraph"style="margin-top:80px;"class="tab">
<p>Deforestation is when people start to clear large areas of woods, trees and plants. This disrupts entire ecosystems and
causes many animals to die, for many to not have a habitat, others to try to migrate elsewhere, while others become extinct
or become endangered altogether. Many pollinators such as bees, butterflies, birds, ants and bats rely on these forests
 for protection against predators, shelter, and food along with wild flowers. By taking down trees we not only decrease the
  production of oxygen, but also our food sources, and our pollinators.</p></div>

<h2>Pesticides</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph"style="margin-top:80px;"class="tab">
<p>Pesticides are chemicals and substances that are used to kill pests, parasites, and unwanted insects. It also include herbicides,
and neonicotinoids. Although these chemicals do not mean to harm many pollinators, sometimes if they are used too much, or are too strong.
 Pollinators can be poisoned by these, and hundreds of pollinators can die, as in bees sometimes.</p>
</div>
<h2>Invasive Species</h2>
<div class="first-paragraph" style="margin-top:80px;"class="tab">
 An invasive species is a new animal or species introduced to a new area that was not previously there. These
 species then can start to cause harm to native species by spreading disease or outcompeting with them. As a
 result the invasive species thrives and flourishes, but the native species start to decline and perish. This
 is the case with many pollinators, such as the honey bee in some cases. The honey bee is not necessarily native
 to the Americas, they were introduced in the 1600s and again in the 1950s. Since they are different species
 they have diseases that they can pass on and new parasites in some cases.
